      The future of AI should be transformative—not incremental. Today, leading
      labs like OpenAI and Anthropic focus on LLMs optimized for human
      assistance. Yet, instead of unleashing a sci-fi vision of commoditized
      intelligence and economic revolution, we've settled for copilots and
      marginal productivity gains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our team—led by Diogo Almeida (OpenAI, Google Brain, co-inventor of
      InstructGPT, RLHF, ChatGPT, and GPT-4), Erik Gafni (Ravel co-founder,
      multimodal AI), and Sasha Sheng (Meta AI)—is redefining this paradigm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leveraging our co-founder's pioneering work in Reinforcement Learning with
      Human Feedback (RLHF) and Instruction-Following models at OpenAI, we've
      fundamentally redesigned LLMs for automation. By re-imagining the entire
      stack from the ground up, we optimize explicitly for AI-to-computer
      interactions rather than human-in-the-loop scenarios.
