        The future of AI should be transformative—not incremental. Today,
        leading labs like OpenAI and Anthropic focus on LLMs optimized for human
        assistance. Yet, instead of unleashing a sci-fi vision of commoditized
        intelligence and economic revolution, we've settled for copilots and
        marginal productivity gains.

      <p>
        Our team—led by Diogo Almeida (OpenAI, Google Brain, co-inventor of
        InstructGPT, RLHF, ChatGPT, and GPT-4), Erik Gafni (Ravel co-founder,
        multimodal AI), and Sasha Sheng (Meta AI)—is redefining this paradigm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leveraging our co-founder's pioneering work in Reinforcement Learning
        with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Instruction-Following models at OpenAI,
        we've fundamentally redesigned LLMs for automation. By re-imagining the
        entire stack from the ground up, we optimize explicitly for
        AI-to-computer interactions rather than human-in-the-loop scenarios.
